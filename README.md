Guardian Australia
==================

A while back Guardian Australia was announced but not yet launched, I thought it would be funny
(and only slightly offensive) to make an upside-down version of the Guardian using CSS.

And here it is: http://revdancatt.github.com/GuardianAustralia/

Guardian Australia is now properly launched and so this is kept here purely for the fond memories.
